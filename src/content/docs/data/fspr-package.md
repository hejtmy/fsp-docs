## FSPR package

Part of the unreal package is a R package that is used to process the data. The package is available on github [here](https://github.com/hejtmy/fspr). The package is not yet available on CRAN, but you can install it directly from github using the following command:

```r
remotes::install_github("hejtmy/fspr")
```

The package is still in development, so expect some changes in the future.
