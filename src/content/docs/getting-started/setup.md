## Requirements

The FSP currently runs in Unreal 4.27. The 5.2+ support is planned, but due to code changes in widgets and editor plugins might take some time.

## Installation

Download: Obtain the Fake Scene Presenter package from the github release page [XXXXX HERE XXXX](XXXXX).

Unreal Engine Integration: Follow standard procedures for integrating plugins into your Unreal Engine project [How to work with plugins](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProductionPipelines/Plugins/). We recommend implementing it to a project, rather than as a global package. Remember to restart UE if you import the package with a project running.
