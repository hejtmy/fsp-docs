## Requirements

FSP plugin currently runs on Unreal engine 4.26 and 4.27. Unreal engine 5 is not supported at this point. There is no reason why it should not work, but it has not been tested throughly at this point.

The plugin still requires some knowledge of Unreal Engine. If you have delievered a single experiment in EU, you should be ready to use it.
